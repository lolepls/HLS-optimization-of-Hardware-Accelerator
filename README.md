# Digital System Design & Methodologies II
## High Level Synthesis - Optimization of an Hardware Accelerator

I have developed this project as a part of the course “Digital System Design & Methodologies” at Politecnico di Milano. The goal of the project is to learn the fundamentals of High Level Synthesis and its tools, with a particular focus on Vitis HLS 2020.3 by Xilinx (the new version of the well-known Vivado HLS) and the features that it provides. 
This work is not meant to be more than an academic exercise.

# Source code and testing results

Source files for this project are not published. In this repo you can however find a detailed report of the work done; it includes also the generation of the testbench and an analysis of the results. In particular, the work done on the accelerator led to an improvement of more than 80% on the performance of the hardware component.
If requested, I can provide .rpt files and more insight on the directives applied and the optimizations done during the work.
